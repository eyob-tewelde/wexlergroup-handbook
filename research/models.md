# Models

A **model** is an _approximate_ computational or theoretical representation of a **system** we want to simulate or study. In the Wexler Group's research, we typically build models by defining the following:

* **Composition**: The ratio of the elements in the system
* **Structure**: The positions of the particles (_i.e._, atoms or ions) relative to an arbitrarily chosen origin
* **Charge**: The difference between the total number of electrons in a system and that in a system of neutral atoms. Negative and positive charges correspond to an excess and deficiency of electrons in the system, respectively.
* **Dimensionality**: The number of axes required to specify the **structure**

## Example 1: A Model of SrTiOâ‚ƒ(_s_)
