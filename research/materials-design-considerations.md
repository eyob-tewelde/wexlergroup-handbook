# Materials Design Considerations

## Elements to Avoid

When designing materials, it's crucial to consider not only the performance of the elements but also their availability and ethical implications. Rare elements, unevenly distributed in the Earth's crust or sourced under questionable human and environmental conditions, should be cautiously considered. Incorporating ethical considerations into materials design helps mitigate environmental and social impacts and reduces potential future challenges related to supply shortages or regulatory constraints.

### Cobalt (Co)

While cobalt-containing compounds have demonstrated excellent performance in applications such as lithium-ion batteries, their extraction comes with significant ethical concerns. A large portion of the world's cobalt is mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), often under conditions that involve human rights violations, including child labor and unsafe working environments. These conditions not only raise moral concerns but also pose long-term risks related to supply chain stability. As such, limiting or avoiding cobalt in materials design is advisable unless sustainable and ethically sourced alternatives can be guaranteed.
