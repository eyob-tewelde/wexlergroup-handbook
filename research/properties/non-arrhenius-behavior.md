# Non-Arrhenius Behavior

Curvature in an Arrhenius plot, ln(rate) or ln(diffusivity) vs. 1/_T_, means that the **assumptions behind the simple Arrhenius law, i.e.,**

* **One temperature-independent barrier and**
* **One temperature-independent prefactor,**

are violated.

## Ways To Break Those Assumptions

| Why the Arrhenius law bends                                                     | How it produces the curvature                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Typical examples                                                                                                                                                           |

| **Competing migration mechanisms** (each individually Arrhenius)                | The total rate is the sum _k_ = ∑ _A_<sub>_i_</sub> exp(-_E_<sub>_i_</sub>/_k_<sub>B</sub>_T_). As _T_ changes, the path with the lower _E_<sub>_i_</sub> dominates at low _T_, but the high-entropy/high-prefactor path can take over at high _T_, so the effective slope (activation energy) changes continuously.                              | Vacancy vs. interstitial hops in bcc Ti, grain-boundary vs. bulk jumps in ionic conductors.                                                                                |
| **Temperature-dependent barrier&#x20;**_**E**_<sub>**m**</sub>**(**_**T**_**)** | Lattice thermal expansion or vibrational anharmonicity lowers the saddle-point energy as T rises; the rate still contains a single exponential, but _E_<sub>m</sub> is no longer constant, so the Arrhenius plot curves gently downward.                                                                                                          | Self-diffusion in β-Ti and Mo.                                                                                                                                             |
| **Temperature-dependent prefactor ν(**_**T**_**)**                              | Soft phonon modes or collective jumps increase the attempt frequency with _T_; if ν(_T_) ≈ ν<sub>0</sub>_T_<sup>_n_</sup>, the prefactor adds a non-linear term _n_ ln(_T_) to ln(_k_).                                                                                                                                                           | Concerted motion in fast-ion conductors; correlated oxygen-vacancy hops in perovskites.

| **Change in defect charge state or local structure**                            | A charge-state crossover (e.g., V<sub>O</sub><sup>••</sup> → V<sub>O</sub><sup>×</sup>) or a local structural transition changes both _E_<sub>m</sub> and ν at the crossover temperature, giving piece-wise Arrhenius segments.                                                                                                                   | Oxygen-vacancy diffusion near the p-to-n crossover in ceria.                                                                                                               |
| **Rate contains formation and migration terms**                                 | In conductivity experiments, σ is proportional to _c_<sub>defect</sub> × Γ. If the _concentration_ term carries a _T_-dependence (extrinsic → intrinsic, association/dissociation, trapping), the apparent activation energy is _E_<sub>f</sub> + _E_<sub>m</sub> at high _T_ but drops toward _E_<sub>m</sub> as defects “freeze-in” at low _T_. | Doped oxides and fluorides; extrinsic ionic conductors.                                                                                                                    |
| **External driving forces or kinetic reversibility**                            | When the forward and reverse hops have comparable barriers, increasing _T_ can increase the _backward_ rate as much as the forward rate, flattening (or even inverting) the Arrhenius slope.                                                                                                                                                      | “Antithermal” grain-boundary migration at cryogenic temperatures.

## What To Look For in Your Data

1. **Fit different&#x20;**_**T**_**-ranges separately.** If each segment is linear but has different slopes, a mechanism change is likely.
2. **Calculate individual barriers** (e.g., NEB for each crystallographically distinct hop) and build a composite rate model _k_(_T_) = Σ _k_<sub>_i_</sub> (_T_). If that reproduces the curvature, multiple paths could be the cause.
3. **Check volume dependence.** Does _E_<sub>m</sub> decrease linearly with the thermal-expansion strain ∂_E_<sub>m</sub>/∂ln(_V_)? If yes, anharmonicity is sufficient to explain the non-Arrhenius behavior.
4. **Monitor defect charge states or local geometry** (ab-initio MD, Monte Carlo, or spectroscopy)—a sudden change at the curvature temperature points to a crossover rather than parallel paths.
