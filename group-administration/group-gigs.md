# Group Gigs

The Wexler Group thrives when every member contributes to the shared infrastructure that powers our science. To make our collective impact larger than the sum of our parts, each member takes on a small group gig—a recurring service role that typically takes **1–2 hours per week** and rotates every semester.

***

## Lead Developer

**Mission:** Steward our in‑house software ecosystem and champion best practices in open‑source development.

**Responsibilities:**

* Maintain the Wexler‑Group GitHub organization: repository structure, permissions, CI, releases, and issue templates.
* Enforce coding style guides, unit‑testing standards, and code‑review procedures.
* Generate and deploy documentation sites.
* Serve as the primary point of contact for external contributors and code questions.

## System Gurus (2 positions)

**Mission:** Keep our computational toolchain running across local servers, WashU clusters, and external HPC resources.

**Responsibilities:**

* Build and maintain executables, modules, tests, and examples for VASP, LAMMPS, Quantum ESPRESSO, Python, Julia, OVITO, VS Code, and other tools.
* Maintain a living **Compilation Cookbook** with step‑by‑step recipes, patch notes, and troubleshooting guides.
* Collaborate with Chris Thuet and IT staff to resolve hardware/software issues.
* Periodically audit software versions and licenses and plan upgrades.

## Communicator‑in‑Chief

**Mission:** Showcase our achievements and keep our web presence current.

**Responsibilities:**

* Update the group website weekly with news, awards, publications, talks, photos, and roster changes.
* Push/build the static site and verify links.
* Coordinate with members to gather content and highlight outreach or media coverage.
* Draft short blurbs for major announcements.

## Documentation Scribe

**Mission:** Grow and curate the Wexler Group knowledge base.

**Responsibilities:**

* Lead a semester‑long initiative to expand internal documentation and tutorials.
* Proactively solicit contributions and track progress with gentle nudges.
* Enforce information architecture and cross‑linking standards.
* Present a quarterly report on documentation coverage and gaps.

***

## Expectations & Rotation

* Roles are assigned at the start of each summer and can be swapped by mutual agreement.
* Each gig should require no more than 1–2 hours per week on average.
* If you hit a roadblock, ask for help early — no one is expected to know everything.
* When you rotate out, prepare hand‑off instructions so the next person can ramp up quickly.
