# Individual Development Plan

While not a formal requirement for our group, Individual Development Plans (IDPs) can be a valuable tool for those interested in setting personal and professional goals. If any group members are interested in developing an IDP, we can work together to create one that aligns with their aspirations and career objectives. The goal is to provide structure for growth while ensuring flexibility to explore various research and career pathways.

## One Approach to IDPs

One possible method for creating an IDP is to blend personal development with structured project management. This approach_, generated by our Department Chair, Jen Heemstra,_ incorporates both short- and long-term goals, making it a flexible and practical tool for ongoing development. In this model, the IDP is updated monthly, and group members prepare a report before meeting to discuss progress. The report could include:

1. A list of long-term goals for the semester and year, covering both research and career development
2. A timeline outlining the steps for each paper in progress, including specific computations
3. A table reflecting the percentage of time dedicated to each project over the last month, as well as the planned time allocation for the next month
4. A color-coded summary of last month's goals: green (completed), orange (in progress), and red (not done)
5. New goals for the upcoming month
6. Any requests or feedback for group management or leadership
7. A meeting agenda, where the group member sets the discussion topics

Although creating the initial report may take some time, regular updates make it a valuable tool for tracking progress, balancing project demands, and aligning career goals.

## ChemIDP

Another possible method for creating an IDP is to use [ChemIDP](https://chemidp.acs.org/), the American Chemical Society's career planning tool.
