# Leave of Absence & Withdrawal Policy

Graduate students who need to take time away from their studies, temporarily (Leave of Absence) or permanently (Withdrawal), must follow the updated procedures established by the Office of Graduate Studies. Adhering to these procedures ensures that your enrollments, grades, accounts, and statuses are updated properly and that you receive the necessary support and resources during your time away and upon your return.

## Requesting a Leave of Absence or Withdrawal

* **Time Away Form**: All students must formally request a Leave of Absence or Withdrawal by completing the [Time Away Form](https://registrar.wustl.edu/time-away-leave-of-absence-or-withdrawal/). This form initiates the official process and notifies relevant campus partners who can provide support and resources.
* **Steps to Follow**:
  1. **Complete the Form**: Provide all required information on the Time Away Form, specifying whether you request a Leave of Absence or a Withdrawal.
  2. **Submit the Form**: Once submitted, the department's graduate coordinator and relevant faculty will be notified to begin the approval process.
  3. **Await Approval**: Your request will be reviewed, and you may be contacted for additional information or to discuss your plans.
  4. **Plan for Your Return** (for Leave of Absence): If taking a temporary leave, work with the department to plan your return and ensure academic continuity.

## Why This Process Is Important

* **Academic Continuity**: Helps maintain your academic standing and makes it easier to resume your studies upon return.
* **Proper Documentation**: Ensures that your academic and financial records accurately reflect your status, preventing potential issues with enrollments or accounts.
* **Access to Resources**: The university can provide necessary support services during your time away.
* **Communication**: Keeps the department informed, enabling faculty and staff to assist you effectively.
