## New postdoc orientation at WashU

The Office of Postdoctoral Affairs (OPA) runs a full day orientation program for any new postdocs joining WashU. Invitations are usually sent to your WashU work email. Please register and attend the orientation as it is a compulsory onboarding task for all new WashU postdocs.
