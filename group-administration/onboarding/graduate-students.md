# Graduate Students

## Opportunity to Join Wexler Group

### Potential applicants

Students interested in the WashU-Chem Ph.D. program and Wexler Group research are welcome to contact Dr. Wexler (wexler\_at\_wustl.edu) anytime for more details.

### New Ph.D. Students

#### Summer project

For incoming graduate students, if you are interested in theoretical and computational chemistry research, please feel free to contact Dr. Wexler (wexler\_at\_wustl.edu) to check the opportunities.

#### Orientation

During August, new chemistry graduate students will attend several orientations held by the Department of Chemistry and Arts & Science.&#x20;

These orientations can help you make friends quickly, understand the Chemistry graduate program better, and prepare for the courses you will take and TA for the following fall semester. You will also have many opportunities to meet with faculty members in the Chemistry Department.

#### Rotation

According to the requirements for the Chmistry Ph.D. program at WashU, new graduate students need to take rotations among 3-4 research groups before submitting their final group choice form in November.

Taking rotation in Wexler Group, we want you attend our group meetings regularly, listen to others' projects, and try to ask questions (there is no stupid question!). You will also have a chance to introduce yourself and your study as well as research experiences.

## Live and Study at WashU

### Study

During the first two years, the graduate students need to complete taking six graduate-level courses (four of them are in the area of your thesis research while the other two are outside)  and teach one class each semester. Discuss with Prof. Wexler about the class you want to take! (You can choose the courses not only open by the Chemistry Department, but also by Physics, Mathematical Statistics, and Engineering Departments.)

The pre-thesis exam need to be completed before the end of the third semester. Therefore, you need to discuss with Prof. Wexler to decide the faculty members you want to invite to be your thesis advisory committee (TAC) during the 1st summer.

You need to contact your TAC regularly and make appointments for annual progress committee meetings to present the updates of your projects.

### Live

The Department of Chemistry is located on [Danforth Campus](https://www.math.wustl.edu/\~beheshti/Danforth-Campus-Map.pdf).

Around the Danforth Campus, WashU owns a lot of real estate which is managed by the [Quadrangle](https://quadrangle.wustl.edu). Graduate students can always find the property you want to rent there with rational cost. In addition, the maintanance service is always prompt and free of charge.

WashU has a good [shuttle system](https://parking.wustl.edu/campus-shuttle-system/) for WashU members to get around campus. They also offers some special services (e.g., [Campus2Home Shuttle](https://parking.wustl.edu/items/campus2home/)) to safely bring you back home even at late night.

For outdoor facilities, there are [track](https://washubears.com/sports/2022/6/6/facilities-francis-field.aspx), [tennis courts](https://washubears.com/sports/2022/6/6/facilities-tao-tennis.aspx) and seceral playing fields. For indoor facilities, there are [gym, basketball courts, swimming pools, and so on](https://washubears.com/sports/recreation). Graduate students are free to use all of them!
