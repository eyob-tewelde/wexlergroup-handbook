# Figures

## Requirements for Figures

All figures should be generated programmatically to ensure reproducibility and consistency across all projects. The following tools are recommended:

* Python: [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org), [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org), [Plotly](https://plotly.com)
* LaTeX: [TikZ](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/TikZ\_package), [pgfplots](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Pgfplots\_package)

### Formatting Guidelines

* **Fonts**: Use sans-serif fonts in all figures for clarity and uniformity.
* **Dimensions**: Figures should adhere to specific dimensions based on the publication layout. Figure widths should be multiples of 3.25 inches:
  * **One-column figures**: 3.25" × 3.25" or 3.25" × 6.5"
  * **Two-column figures**: 6.5" × 3.25" or 6.5" × 6.5"

## Inspiration

For inspiration and guidance, consider consulting the following resources:

* [**The Python Graph Gallery**](https://python-graph-gallery.com): Offers many examples on creating effective visualizations using Python libraries.
* [**TikZ and pgfplots in LaTeX**](https://tikz.net): Examples of graphics created with TikZ in LaTeX can provide excellent models for designing scientific figures.

These requirements, guidelines, and recommendations ensure that all figures in presentations and publications maintain a professional and consistent appearance that is aligned with group and publication standards.
