# Suggestions for Getting Started

1. **Discuss Your Research**: Explain your research to coworkers to refine your understanding and gain feedback.
2. **Visualize Your Data**: Identify figures, schemes, charts, and tables that best illustrate your research and support your conclusions.
3. **Create Figures**: Dedicate time to creating all necessary figures and select the most effective ones.
4. **Draft an Outline**: Prepare an outline with sections for the title, authors, affiliations, abstract, introduction, computational methods, results and discussion, conclusions, acknowledgments, and references.
5. **Integrate Figures**: Place your figures within the outline to guide the structure of your manuscript.
6. **Paragraph Planning**: Determine the number of paragraphs needed to connect and explain the concepts between each figure. Add placeholders for each paragraph in the outline.
7. **Sentence Planning**: Estimate the number of sentences required to explain the concept within each paragraph. Add placeholders for each sentence.
8. **Clear Writing**: Write each sentence clearly and concisely, using the active voice where possible. Avoid excessive use of prepositions (e.g., of, on, with) and forms of the verbs "to be" (is, are, has). Aim for \~80% of your sentences to follow the format: "Our results show \_\_\_\_\_." Refer to "Revising Business Prose" for additional style tips.
9. **Write Core Sections Last**: Save the introduction, conclusions, and abstract for the final stages of writing.
10. **Journal Template**: If you have a target journal, download its manuscript template early and familiarize yourself with its sections and requirements.
11. **Reference Management**: Insert references early using Zotero, but don't hesitate to write freely to get your ideas on paper.
12. **Review and Revise**: Read the manuscript from start to finish as an outside reader. Eliminate redundancies and fill in any logical gaps.
13. **Compliance Check**: Ensure your manuscript meets the requirements in the Manuscript\_Checklist.pdf[^1].
14. **Iterate**: Repeat the review and revision process as needed.

By following these steps, you'll streamline your manuscript writing process and enhance the clarity and impact of your research presentation.
