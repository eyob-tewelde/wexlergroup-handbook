## Cover Art

While we haven't done this much in the past, I'd be open to paying to get cover art done for especially high-impact manuscripts. Some artists we've worked with in the past are:

* Kristen Amyx-Sherer (a.kristen@wustl.edu)
* Ella Maru Studio, Inc.
  * Ella Maru, Art-director (info@ellamarustudio.com)
  * Alex Tokarev, CEO
  * Charleston, SC, USA
