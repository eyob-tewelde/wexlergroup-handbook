## Travel Guidelines for Flights and Hotels

When traveling on sponsored funding, please adhere to the following guidelines to ensure compliance with Washington University policies and to facilitate prompt reimbursement.

### Flights

* **Price Comparison**: Use travel sites like Google Flights, Expedia, or other aggregators **for price comparison purposes only**. These platforms are useful for finding the best rates and schedules across different airlines.
* **Booking**: Book your flights **directly with the airline** or through an approved WashU travel agency after comparing prices. **Do not book flights through third-party travel sites like Expedia**.
* **International Travel**: For international air travel on sponsored funding, **booking with an American-owned airline is required**, even if fares are higher than those of foreign airlines. This complies with the Fly America Act.
* **WashU Travel Resources**: You may utilize WashU's preferred travel agencies or resources for business travel. Visit the following links for more information:

### Hotels

* **Discounted Rates**: Conference organizers often provide discounted rates for hotel bookings. **Take advantage of these rates when possible**.
* **Booking**: Similar to flights, book your hotel accommodations **directly with the hotel** or through an approved WashU travel agency. **Do not book hotels through third-party travel sites like Expedia**.
* **Minimizing Costs**: When possible, schedule your flights and travel plans to **minimize the number of nights** you must stay, thereby reducing total travel costs.

### Expense Reimbursement

* **Receipts and Documentation**: Keep all **itemized receipts** for your expenses. When submitting expenses for reimbursement, send an email to **V** with:
  * Your itemized receipts.
  * The **conference agenda**.
  * A short **justification** explaining how the travel benefits the aims of the project.
* **Policy Compliance**: Ensure that all expenses comply with WashU's travel policies. Refer to the attached policy document (if available) or contact the department's financial operations manager for clarification.
* File for reimbursement within 15 days after the trip.

### General Tips

* **Advance Planning**: Book your travel well in advance to secure the best rates and ensure compliance with all policies.
* **Assistance**: If you have any questions or need help booking flights or hotels, please contact the department's financial operations team.

## Departmental Support for Upfront Costs

To ensure that all students have the opportunity to attend conferences and meetings, the department offers support for upfront travel costs. This support is especially important if covering these costs in advance would cause financial hardship or prevent a student from attending.

If any student requires assistance with upfront expenses for flights, hotels, or other costs, they can reach out to the following contacts for help:

* [**Virginia "V" Watts**](https://chemistry.wustl.edu/people/virginia-v-watts)\
  Email: vwatts@wustl.edu\
  Phone: (314) 935-6575
* [**Cynthia "Cindy" Hodge**](https://chemistry.wustl.edu/people/cynthia-cindy-hodge)\
  Email: hernkec@wustl.edu\
  Phone: (314) 935-6521

All requests will be handled privately, and the expenses will be charged to the appropriate grants, PI-provided funds, or subsidy accounts as usual. The goal is to make these opportunities accessible to all students without placing them in a financially difficult situation while they await reimbursement.
