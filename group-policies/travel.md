# Travel

* **Conference Registration:** Check if membership is required or provides a discount.
* **Flights:** Compare airfares across all airlines for the cheapest rate. Google Flights is a good resource for this. For international air travel, booking with an American-owned airline is required, even if fares are higher than those of foreign airlines.
* **Hotel:** Conference organizers often provide discounted rates for hotel bookings. When possible, book flights that minimize the number of nights of stay to reduce total travel costs.
* **Reimbursement:** Keep all receipts for reimbursement once the trip is concluded. File for reimbursement within 15 days after the trip.
* **Poster Printing:** Leave enough time for poster printing.

## Travel Funds Through the Chemistry Department

After placement with a research group, each graduate student is eligible for $400 per academic year for conference travel when presenting a poster or giving a talk.

## Departmental Support for Upfront Costs

To ensure that all students have the opportunity to attend conferences and meetings, the department offers support for upfront travel costs. This support is especially important if covering these costs in advance would cause financial hardship or prevent a student from attending.

If any student requires assistance with upfront expenses for flights, hotels, or other costs, they can reach out to the following contacts for help:

* [**Virginia "V" Watts**](https://chemistry.wustl.edu/people/virginia-v-watts)\
  Email: vwatts@wustl.edu\
  Phone: (314) 935-6575
* [**Cynthia "Cindy" Hodge**](https://chemistry.wustl.edu/people/cynthia-cindy-hodge)\
  Email: hernkec@wustl.edu\
  Phone: (314) 935-6521

All requests will be handled privately, and the expenses will be charged to the appropriate grants, PI-provided funds, or subsidy accounts as usual. The goal is to make these opportunities accessible to all students without placing them in a financially difficult situation while they await reimbursement.
