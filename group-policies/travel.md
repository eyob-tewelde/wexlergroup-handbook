# Travel

* Conference registration: check if a membership is required, or provides discount
* Flights: compare air fares across all airlines for the cheapest rate, Google Flights is a good site for that. Note that for international air travels, booking with an American-owned airlines is required, even fares are higher than foreign airlines.&#x20;
* Hotel: conference organizers often provide discount rate for hotel booking,&#x20;
  * when possible, book the flights that minimize the number of nights of stay to reduce the total travel cost.
* Keep all receipts for reimbursement once the trip is concluded. File for reimbursement within 15 days after the trip.
* Leave enough time for poster printing.&#x20;
